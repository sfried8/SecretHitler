# Secret Hitler
This game is designed to be played locally with each player using a web-connected device to connect to a server, sort of like Jackbox Party Pack games. I am creating this for fun to teach myself Typescript, back-end Javascript, socket.io, and Vue.js (and reactive frameworks in general).
